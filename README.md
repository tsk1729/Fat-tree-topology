## FAT TREE TOPOLOGY
Fat Tree Topology is used in data center networks to loadbalance several requests.This repo contributed base class topohelper and Fat tree topology helper to NeST that could be futuristically useful. This topology was not yet added to NeST pipeline because NeST switch doesn't have features like ns3 switch.
